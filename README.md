# PreSonus Revelator io24 API (Unofficial)

This project is to be able to control a PreSonus Revelator io24 interface through an API.
This way we can have **automations** and **plugins** for Stream Deck, Touch Portal, Loupedeck, and more.

This API might also work for other Revelator models (currently only tested with a io44), but limited.

## Status on project

2025.05.24: After a couple of years **my interface died**. If I am not able to get another one for cheap, this project will see minimal or no maintainance.

## Progress

- API: Still early, but many features are implemented. Try the Windows App to see what is possible.
- Stream Deck plugin: Fat Channel Toggle, Routing, presets and headphone sources, with status.
- Touch Portal plugin: Volume control, Fat Channel Toggle, Routing, presets and headphone sources, with status.
- Loupedeck plugin: Volume control, Fat Channel Toggle, Routing, presets and headphone sources, with status.

## Warnings

- This project is in the **early stages**, expect some bugs.
- There will be **breaking changes** between updates.

## About the API

The `Universal Control` and `UC Surface` apps can be used to control some devices from PreSonus. The apps uses a protocol called [UCNET](https://www.presonussoftware.com/en_US/technology) that is not well documented, and easy to use by third parties.

This project aims to document and understand the part of this protocol that is used when comunicating with the io24, and create an API that is more understandable for making plugins, automations and such. There are already similar APIs like this for some other devices, but theese does not seem to work for this particular device.
